# Hotbox-Pizza-FLASK
I have made this website as a practice project. Here, I used Python's FLASK micro-framework for backend development, used HTML, CSS and some bootstrap for my frontend side.

I have made a login system using flask-login, such that the website is fully authenticated.
For databse connectivity, I have used MySQL using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
